This is the first assignment worked on as part of the Games Concepts module in my Computer Science course. This is a pac-man style game where the player controls a sphere with camera perspective available from both an isometric and top-down point of view. The objective of the game is for the player to collect cubes while staying within the game boundaries (platform) in order to reach a number of points. This game has been developed in TL-Engine and C++.

During the development of the game, I have learned about making full use of the C++ suite of variable types including arrays and enums as well as player experience and feedback. Furthemore, I have learned about the importance of the development process and following an Agile-style framework in order to yield the best results.

The game features:

- Playersphere with responsive controls
- Re-spawning cubes that the player must collect
- 'Hypercube' which causes the playersphere to attract cubes within a certain radius for a specified amount of time
- Collision detection using sphere to cube collision methods

Features I intend to add:

- AI sphere
- Level progression
